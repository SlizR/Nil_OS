# Nil OS Security & Isolation Statement

### Product Branding and Security Assurance

**Product Name:** Nil OS

**Developed by:** Sliz®

**Security Partner:** ***EVADE** Security Service*

Nil OS is engineered for maximal performance on minimal hardware while maintaining robust data integrity and user privacy. Our security commitment is formalized through the following features:

### 1. Secured by EVADE (EVADE Security)

The designation **"Secured by EVADE"** signifies an ongoing commitment to the security and maintenance of the Nil OS platform. This includes:

* **Continuous Auditing:** Regular security checks and vulnerability assessments of the core system components.
* **Guaranteed Security Updates:** Integration of security patches with every official OS update, ensuring the system remains protected against known exploits.

### 2. Live System Data Isolation and Private Territory

A fundamental feature of Nil OS, powered by the **EVADE Security Service**, is the absolute isolation of user changes and data from the host computer's internal storage.

**Core Isolation Principle:**

> **When Nil OS is run as a Live system from a removable drive (such as a USB flash drive), all user modifications, configuration changes, and saved data are written exclusively to the flash drive itself.**

**Resulting Guarantee:**

> **System Isolation:** "I inserted a flash drive with the operating system (Nil OS) into the computer, made changes, and all the data was saved to the flash drive, and nothing changed or was saved on the PC."

This creates a **"Private Territory"** on the flash drive, ensuring user privacy and protecting the integrity of the host machine's operating system and hard drive.
