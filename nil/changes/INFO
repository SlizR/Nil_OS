Attention! This file is used to save the operating system to a disk (flash drive). The archive is currently empty before the OS launches, but if you attempt to make any changes to the OS itself, a copy will be created.

Please do not modify the saved system archives, otherwise data may be lost. Do not add or use this folder for any other purposes. (Please note that this is the system folder for your changes.)
